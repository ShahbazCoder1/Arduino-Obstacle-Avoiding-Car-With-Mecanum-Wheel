Greetings everyone, and welcome to my GitHub tutorial. Today, I'll guide you through the process of creating an Arduino Obstacle Avoiding Car with Mecanum Wheel.

## Project Overview:

In this project, we will use an Ultrasonic Sensor to measure distances. Based on the detected distance, the car will take appropriate actions. For example, if an obstacle is detected within 20 cm, the car will change its path by performing an omnidirectional movement.
#### Without further ado, let's dive into the project and get started!
## Supplies:

| 3D Printed Chassis   | Arduino Uno             | Motor Driver            | Ultrasonic Sensor       |

I used Tinkercad to plan and design my project. I designed this chassis with three things in mind: easy assembly, 3D printability, and affordability. After finalizing the design, I exported the file in STL format to ensure it was ready for 3D printing. The attached file includes all necessary components and dimensions for accurate printing and straightforward assembly. For even greater affordability, you can also consider CNC cutting the chassis frame from an acrylic sheet.

Follow the Instructions:

1. Mount the Arduino Uno and L298D Motor Driver Shield to the chassis.
2. Connect the Gear Motor wires to the Motor Driver motor pin as shown in the circuit diagram.
3. Carefully mount the Ultrasonic Sensor to the front part of the chassis using hot glue.
4. Follow the Ultrasonic Sensor connection from Image No. 3.
5. Mount the Battery Holder to the chassis as shown in the image.
